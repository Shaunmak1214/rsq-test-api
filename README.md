# Predictive Courier Maintenance

## Quick Start

#### Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/Shaunmak1214/rsq-test-api.git`

#### Install necessary dependencies

`yarn install`

#### Check environment variables

- Setup your own mongodb instance on local or remotely via mongodb atlas or other providers

`vim .env`

#### Start server

`yarn dev`

#### Setup Users and postman scripts

I've setup a [postman collection](https://www.postman.com/rodeosuperapp/workspace/rsq) with all the endpoints and scripts to test the api.

_note: The access token is automatically added into postman's environments, so you don't have to populate this everytime you make a authenticated request._

#### Feature Highlights

1. Maintenance Reports
2. Vehicles
3. Shipments
4. Drivers
5. Users
